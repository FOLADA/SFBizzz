# Business Owner Review Prevention Implementation

This document describes the implementation of a logical constraint that prevents business owners from submitting reviews on their own businesses.

## Overview

The system now enforces that business owners cannot review their own businesses through both frontend UI logic and backend validation. This helps maintain the integrity of the review system by preventing self-promotion and biased reviews.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema Changes

**File: `SFBizbck/db.py`**

- Added `owner_id` field to the `businesses` table
- Foreign key constraint linking businesses to their owners
- Automatic migration for existing databases

```sql
ALTER TABLE businesses ADD COLUMN owner_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id);
```

### 2. Backend Changes

**File: `SFBizbck/routes.py`**

#### Business Creation
- Modified `/businesses` POST endpoint to require authentication (`@require_auth`)
- Business creation now associates the business with the authenticated user
- All new businesses will have an `owner_id` set

#### Review Validation
- Added owner check in review creation endpoint
- Returns 403 error with message "You cannot review your own business" if owner tries to review
- Prevents review submission at the API level

#### Owner Check Endpoint
- New endpoint: `GET /businesses/{business_id}/owner-check`
- Returns `{"isOwner": boolean}` indicating if current user owns the business
- Requires authentication

### 3. Frontend Changes

**File: `sfbizfrnt/lib/api.ts`**
- Added `checkBusinessOwner()` function to check ownership status
- Handles authentication and error cases gracefully

**File: `sfbizfrnt/components/ReviewsSection.tsx`**
- Added owner status checking logic
- Conditionally renders review form based on ownership
- Shows informative message for business owners
- Prevents review form display for owners

**File: `sfbizfrnt/app/add/page.tsx`**
- Updated to require authentication for business creation
- Added login prompts for unauthenticated users
- Disabled form inputs when not authenticated
- Includes authorization header in business creation requests

## User Experience

### For Business Owners
- Cannot see or access the review form on their own business pages
- See a clear message: "You cannot review your own business. This helps maintain the integrity of our review system."
- Cannot submit reviews through API calls (backend validation)

### For Regular Users
- Can review any business they don't own
- Normal review functionality remains unchanged
- Clear authentication requirements for business creation

### For Unauthenticated Users
- Cannot create businesses (login required)
- Cannot submit reviews (login required)
- Clear prompts to login or register

## Error Handling

### Backend Errors
- **403 Forbidden**: "You cannot review your own business"
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication required for business creation
- **409 Conflict**: User already reviewed this business (existing logic)

### Frontend Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if owner check fails
- Clear error messages for authentication requirements
- Disabled UI elements when actions are not allowed

## Testing

### Test Scripts
1. **`test_owner_review_prevention.py`**: Comprehensive test of the prevention logic
2. **`SFBizbck/cleanup_owner_reviews.py`**: Script to clean up existing owner reviews

### Test Scenarios
- ✅ Business owner cannot submit review (backend validation)
- ✅ Business owner sees appropriate UI message
- ✅ Non-owners can submit reviews normally
- ✅ Authentication required for business creation
- ✅ Owner check endpoint works correctly

## Migration and Cleanup

### For Existing Data
- Existing businesses without `owner_id` will have `NULL` values
- Use `cleanup_owner_reviews.py` to identify and remove any existing owner reviews
- Script provides detailed output and confirmation before deletion

### Running Cleanup
```bash
cd SFBizbck
python cleanup_owner_reviews.py
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Backend Validation**: Primary enforcement happens on the server
2. **Frontend Enhancement**: UI improvements for better UX
3. **Authentication Required**: Business creation now requires login
4. **Owner Verification**: Secure endpoint to check ownership status

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoints
- `GET /businesses/{business_id}/owner-check` - Check if user owns business

### Modified Endpoints
- `POST /businesses` - Now requires authentication and sets owner_id
- `POST /reviews` - Now includes owner validation

## Future Enhancements

1. **Admin Panel**: Interface to manage business ownership
2. **Ownership Transfer**: Allow business owners to transfer ownership
3. **Review Moderation**: Additional review validation for suspicious patterns
4. **Audit Logging**: Track ownership changes and review attempts

## Compliance

This implementation ensures:
- ✅ Business owners cannot review their own businesses
- ✅ Clear user feedback and error messages
- ✅ Both frontend and backend validation
- ✅ Existing reviews by owners can be identified and removed
- ✅ Authentication requirements for business creation
- ✅ Graceful error handling and fallbacks
